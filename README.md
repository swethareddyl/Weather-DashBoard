# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Task

Build a weather dashboard using third-party APIs to access their data with specific parameters in URL that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [Current Weather API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) and [5 Day forecast API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions.  Used `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a weather dashboard with form inputs, when I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

2. When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

3. When I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

4. When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
